# Traffic_lights_simulation

A java program to simulate traffic and traffic lights. The cars come randomly and they are added to the collection of cars until the collection has 100 cars in the queue
and they can only go when the light is green, or yellow but when the light is red cars will stay in the queue. 

The yellow light lasts for 10 seconds , the green one 30 seconds and the red one 20 seconds.

When when the light is green the cars go , one by one (every second a car gets out )

When the light is yellow , the cars go , one by one (every two seconds one  car gets out , because yellow is for caution so the cars are going a little slower )

When the light is red, no car gets to go . They all stay where they are.

The program ends when all the cars in the collection are gone.
